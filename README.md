### Create a local dev environment

For as long as you simply wish to edit raw page content text, you can do all of your content edits directly from the GitHub web interface.
Do mind the fact that markdown can be finnicky at times, so make sure your edits look exactly the way you want them to.

If you want to edit things more intricately, or to preview the website locally, you can follow the steps listed in [here](create-local-dev-env.md).

### Markdown cheat-sheet

You can find our markdown convention best practices cheat-sheet [here](markdown-cheat-sheet.md).

### Edit an existing page

On every page there is an "Edit this page" button on the right side of the page, as well as at the bottom of the page.

You can click on it, edit the page, and suggest the change as a pull request. The Overwolf team will then review it, and merge it if the change is deemed to be of value to readers.

### Add a new page

In order to add a new page, you should:

1. Choose where the page should fit within the website. The sidebar structure of the website directly corresponds to the file hierarchy.
2. Create a new file with the [`.mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/) file extension in the right place.
